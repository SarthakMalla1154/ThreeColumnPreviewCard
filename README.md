## Overview

This is a challenged that helped me streghthen my skills with CSS FlexBox Layout. I applied the Mobile-First approach to complete this challenge, and in doing so learned much about how it worked and how I could implement other codes for bigger screens.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest concept I learned through this challenge was the use of FlexBox. I am surprised how it simplified things. Also, I learned about buttons and the 'hover' pseudo-attribute(I guess).

```css
.button{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
    border: 2px solid hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
    padding: 15px 32px;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: "Lexend Deca";
    margin: 4px 2px;
    cursor: pointer;
    border-radius: 55px;
}
.button:hover{
    background-color: transparent;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
}
```
